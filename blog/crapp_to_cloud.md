# Crapp to Cloud

Oh, yes, this is work in progress. But experience needs to be told.

Yes we have a lot of old legazy crapp. We were at a stage where morale was at a lowpoint. And despair was at a high. That's when people were fed up, and start shovle the crapp.
So that's what we are going to do. Because there are nobody else to do it.
That's what responsible people in organisations with responsibilities do.
