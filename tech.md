## Why write about tech 
Tech is my daily business. It's what I do.
In essence I'm interested in making tech deliver the value it promises. 
This means diving deep into the depths of shitty and complicated code. And soaring high in the skies to see the trends in the landscape. And dipping my toes into management of tech people.
