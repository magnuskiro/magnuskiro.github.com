# Security tools

Definitely needed stuff. 

# Snyk
Has automated pull requests to update dependencies.

# White source
The issue feed is used by github I think.

# Github advanced security
Including the lgtm.com stuff is quite powerfull.
Mostly free for open source stuff. 

Dependency scanning! Automated pull requests and security audit emails. That's
cool. Even needed. 

# Zap OWASP
Does OWASP scanning of your repo. 

# Gitlab
Seems like a nice competitor to github.

# Azure devops??
I know they have some scanning stuff in their pipelines, but it's not dedicated
such as Snyk.
