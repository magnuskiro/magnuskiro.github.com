# Cloud Foundry

WIP

## BOSH

In the same category as Ansible, Terraform, ARM templates, Cloudformation etc.
An alternative to terraform.

Infrastructure as code. Creating manifest.yml file to define the resources and
environment you want to spin up. Using all the cloud vendors or on-prem/vSphere
as a platform for running VMs etc. 

# CFCR: Cloud Foundry Container Runtime
