# Crap to Cloud

WIP 

Do you have a lot of old legacy crap?
Are you at a stage where morale is low and despair is high. 
That's when people are fed up, and start shoveling the crap.
So that's what people do. Because there are nobody else to do it.
That's what responsible people in organisations with responsibilities do. 

They start moving in a direction. To get movement. Like your car stuck in the
mud. Rock it back and forth to get traction. Try to get your footing back so
you can move forwards.

# Some interesting aspects to consider.

Timeline - What would you like this to be completed?
History - What have you tried before? Which experiences can you learn from?
Culture - Is you organisation ready? Eager? And which approach should your org
take?

# The plan

The basic lift and shift plan is to "just move everything". Then you figure out
thats quite difficult. So you start to analyse the situation you have. 
Actually looking at the crap you have in your garage and how old your lawn
mower is... that's an ugly truth nobody want to talk about.

Sometimes I think the basics are: 
* What do we have?
* Let's think.
* Ignorance if bliss!
* GET THE SHOVELS!

The you start digging your way into a ditch. Digging in a digression that will take
forever. Did you do the good old traditional project management approach? 
Fun times for the spreadsheet guru! But when did that ever put things in motion?

# Visibility

Share progress and be transparent. 



# Results?
Time passes and people move on. The result are what they are. But in my
experience not good. Early adoption on small things are best. 
Get in get experience. Get value. Then get compliance. Rome was not built in
one day. Probably the first 300 years was spend figuring out there the entrance
was. Then buildings formed. 

What I'm saying is that it takes a lot of time to build competence. And while
you do that you need to have return on your investments, aka get the value out
fast! Figuring out how the cloud will give you value is the most important
thing. Then you can focus on getting that value out of it. All the other
details will subordinate under the value goal.

# Where is the quick win? 
In the lining. Keep compliance at bay so that you can move the tech stuff.
