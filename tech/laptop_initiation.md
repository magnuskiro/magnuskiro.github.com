# So what to do when you have a fresh laptop?

## really choose a good computer as well.
I currently run a thinkpad p43s. The new t14 series is really good. Just have enough RAM, CPU, and LTE capability.

## What operating system should you have?
I'm currently back on windows. I find it more flexible atm. Mostly because the developer experience has been greatly improved the last couple of years. 
And all my games work!

Well... I actually have dual boot. But mostly use windows. 

## Do windows update
All of it, often, and until all the updates are there. I have experience with corporate crap, aka laptops that are company wide managed with lots and lots of agents on it .... yuck.

Have it clean.

## windows stuff? - yes
- Set up facial recognition thingy to do fast logins. And a pin.
- And connect your phone! It's so nice to send messages and read notifications from your computer.

## Tools ?
* package manager: `winget` or chocolaty. Now I prefer `winget`.
* chrome
* Linux subsystem for windows.
* Developer tools: dotnet, maven, java, vs code, git, docker, etc... all installed with `winget` or chocolaty
* Steam? - some gaming happens now and then!

## Git Bash Configuration: 
create the .bashrc file with ``source ./.bash_aliases`` in it to load all the good aliases I use.

## Git config!
Pretty soon I clone my config and script repo from github and symlink the gitconfig ``ln -s ./repos/configs.gitconfig .gitconfig``

## Start using!
