# Evaluating CICD solutions

## Bitbucket
Cloud and on-prem server. 
Cloud has pipeline functionality, this is lacking on the on-prem server.
Self-hosted build agents are missing.

By looking at the bitbucket web pages for iformation there is little that
suggests that self-hosted is viable for the future. Compared to the little I
know about github self-hosted capabilities Bitbucket becomes nearly uselsss.
(I might be boiased in the matter, so take this with a pinch of salt.)
