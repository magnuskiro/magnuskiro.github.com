# First! 

On the long list of todo items and possibilities, for self improvement and
personal marketing, a personal website is a place to begin. 

And that's what I'm doing. I'm creating a place for personal growth and
promotion. A blog for technology. A personal business. A face to the internet.
My own personal playground. And a window into my interests.

So first things first. Figure out the 'how', then fill in the 'what'.  

## The technical solution. 
This site is a basc github personal page with a standard style sheed and
layout. 

Then I used the pagedown[!link] js library to parse markdown to html. I
suspect that github already does that, but it's nice to have created that
functionality to use in future projects. 

Articles/posts and content is stored as .md files in the content folder, while
the javascript keeps track of categories, tagging and such, so that I can have
a menu to differentiate the content and hav sub pages on my page.

Thats the poorly written site idea. Only the implementation and documentation
left. That should be fun. 

## Todo

The road to completion is long and never ending. So for the moment I see the
following future improvements to be made as follows. 

1. Update my presense on the internet by reworking my social profiles
(linkedin, twitter, facebook, g+)
2. Update this site to be functional with a menu and sidebar. 
3. Improve the content of this siste to be informational and relevant for it's
uses.
4. Start blogging about my interests and share it with the willing readers.
