# There be blog?

Yes there might be a blog.
I intend to share my thoughts and perceptions on subjects I find important and
interesting.
My ponderings are enlightening and interesting for me. If they are for you as
well that's a bonus :)

Oh, and this site is very much a work in progress. Currently there is some sort
of a structure. So now it's time to focus on content.

I write for my self. 
I write to remember.
I write to get things out of my head. 
I write to deal with impressions of the world. 
I write to promote tech.
I write to solve tech problems. 
I write to improve my leadership.
I write to improve devops, platforms and infrastructure.
